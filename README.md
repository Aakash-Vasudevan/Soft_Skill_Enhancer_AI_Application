# Soft Skill Enhancer AI Application

## Overview

The **Soft Skill Enhancer** is an AI-powered application designed to help individuals improve their soft skills, including vocabulary, communication, and speaking abilities. The application provides multiple features, including:

- **Speech-to-Text Practice**: Convert speech to text using AI-powered speech recognition.
- **Vocabulary Quiz**: Enhance vocabulary through dynamic quizzes with definitions fetched directly from the web.
- **AI-Generated Feedback**: Receive real-time feedback on your grammar and fluency based on text input, helping you identify areas for improvement.

The application leverages popular AI models like Wav2Vec 2.0 for speech-to-text, TextBlob for grammar checks, and dynamic word fetching from the internet for vocabulary development.

## Features

### 1. **Speech-to-Text Practice**
   - The application uses AI-driven speech recognition technology (Google Web Speech API or Wav2Vec 2.0) to transcribe spoken words into text.
   - Users can practice speaking and receive feedback on the clarity and accuracy of their speech.

### 2. **Vocabulary Quiz**
   - The vocabulary quiz fetches random words and their definitions from the internet via a public dictionary API.
   - Users are quizzed on their knowledge by choosing the correct definition from a list of multiple-choice options.
   - The quiz helps users learn new words in an interactive and engaging way.

### 3. **AI-Generated Feedback**
   - The application provides instant feedback on the text input by users using TextBlob.
   - Feedback is given based on grammar and fluency, helping users improve their language skills.
